# Number Guessing Game

Hey there! Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!

This is a small, fun game where you and the computer have a little guessing competition. You get to choose a number between 1 and 100, and the computer will do the same. Whoever picks the higher number each round gets a point! The game lasts for six rounds, and at the end, whoever has the most points wins. Simple, right?

## How to Play

1. You'll be asked to enter a number between **1 and 100**.
2. The computer will then also "guess" a number.
3. If your number is higher, you win the round. If the computer's number is higher, it wins the round. If they're the same, it's a draw!
4. There are **6 rounds** in total.
5. After all the rounds, the final scores will be shown to determine the winner.

### Example
You'll see something like:
```
Enter number: 45
Computer guesses: 34
You won
Your score is: 1 and computer's score is: 0
```

At the end of the game, you'll get a summary like:
```
Game Over! Your score is: 3 and computer's score is: 2
You won!
```

## Requirements

To run the game, all you need is a C++ compiler. If you're using something like `g++`, just type:
```
g++ -o guessing_game guessing_game.cpp
./guessing_game
```

## Have Fun!

Give it a try, challenge yourself, and see if you can beat the computer! ðŸ˜Š

Feel free to play around with the code to make it more challenging or add some cool features. Maybe extend the number of rounds or change the range of numbers. Enjoy and happy coding!
